**Hi! I am a designer in upstate New York who enjoys making silly things for the web.** Currently I'm fumbing around with 11ty. I care about accessibility, funtionality and design in that order. I am always seeking new ways to improve my craft. Althugh I've been making Tumblr themes since 2013, I didn't start to sit down and seriously learn web developement (outside of Tumblr) until I was temporarily off of work for a few months mid 2020.

Web designing aside, I enjoy reading, watching movies and playing the occasional video game. You can read my thoughts on them [on my personal blog](https://smolnotes.netlify.app/media/). I also am a coffee junkie, like running and visiting new places.

### Now

* Tending to [my little site](https://smolnotes.netlify.app/)
* When I'm not lazy, adding more [braille contractions](https://braille.netlify.app/)
* Trying to [read books](https://smolnotes.netlify.app/books/)
* Make chess a thing for [where I live](https://albanychess.netlify.app/)
