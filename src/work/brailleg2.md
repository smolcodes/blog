## Goal 

This is a quick guide to help people remember grade 2 braille contractions and rules. 

The search could certainly use more work. The goal was to try to make this as accessible as possible. To this end, I have much to do. The braille needs to be both read by a screen reader and also braille device (this part I need to work on as I don't have a digital braille device). Keyboard navigation is okay.

## Tools

Deployed with Netlify and hosted on Githuh. It uses 11ty to do the heavy lifting and Tailwind for the design.
