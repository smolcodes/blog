The Albany Area Chessclub (AAC) currently doesn't have a dedicated site. This project aims to correct that.

Chess is a game that is known for building intellect. It is also competitive,fun and even whimsical. The design of the site embodies those characteristics. With friendly pastel colors and two large horses to greet the user, the user will understand what this club is about. The large title heading is [Cinzel Decorative](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cinzel+Decorative). This bold font evokes the covers of books and magazines such as ChessWorld, The Spectator, The New Statesmen and The Nation. The body is set to Spectral for its easy reading experience.

The primary color for headings is <code>#ef4444</code>. This is a reference again to the bold magazine choices of the 1800's and 1900's. It is eye grabbing but not as intense as crimson red. The link colors are <codde>#fefce8</code>. And finally the post date is <code>#eff6ff</code>. Perhaps unintentionally, I did end up gettting immensly inspired by *The Economist* and *Foreign Affairs*. 

The site also has illustrations that should envoke a vintage, fun feel. 

The framework of choice for the design is TailwindCSS. It is incredibly fast. It is easy to maintain and easy to change. This might, of course, be due to the simplicity of the sight. AAC is  made with the static site generator 11ty because of its ease of use, rapid setup and simple use case. It is hosted on Github and deployed with Netlify.

The illustrations coupled with bold fonts and strong colors brings home what one can expect coming to the Albany Area Chess club: a *seriously fun* time.
