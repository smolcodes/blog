## Goal and History of Smolthemes

I began tinkering around with coding in 2013. It mostly consisted of modifying existing code as I didn't know CSS and HTML. Eventually I took the leap of learning to create themes by following tutorials from [Build Themes](https://buildthemes.tumblr.com/). 

While I didn't take the traditional route of learning web design, I wouldn't call myself self taught. I learned a lot from people who created the Tumblr documentaion, Jennifer Neaderst Robbins (who wrote [this amazing book](https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uN7kAT9FidcC&source=productsearch&utm_source=HA_Desktop_US&utm_medium=SEM&utm_campaign=PLA&pcampaignid=MKTAD0930BO1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwqsHWBRDsARIsALPWMEN6PenNn36ZugrC6Sgk6FROP7VF7CKoZ2i2Jhzo0qy2SJQ-26JT3asaAgXPEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds&dclid=CJCC8Z64uNoCFYuZyAodG7UMdg) ), Monique Tendencia and so many other amazing tutorial creators.

Currently I use Tumblr as a way to test new concepts and tools I've learned such as flexbox, grid, css animations and design systems. You can install all workable themes on [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/themes/by/slurppi). A repository of most of the codes dating back from way back when can be found on [Github](https://github.com/smolcodes/Tumblr-Themes). I will warn you that the themes are not maintained and most themes might not be usable as Tumblr made a huge update two years ago.
