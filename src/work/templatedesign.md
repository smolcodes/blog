## Starbucks Coffee Tasting

Starbucks has an amazing graphics department. The design for the display of information on the side of the bags of coffee are beautiful. In 2018 while preparing for the Barista Championships I thought I would try my hand at designing an information card using Microsoft Word. The typefaces used are Verdana and Georgia. 

### Overall Design

I delibaretly chose a gray palette because our printers at work don't print in color. The added bonus of this choice is people with different visual abilities would be able to view this. 

The flow of the information sheet was to present the most pertinent information first and then afterwards the more flowy content. The first line at the top has the event name. Below that is the name of the coffee as well as quick important information next to it. Because the primary target is English speakers, I designed the layout to flow left to right, with headers being bold on the left.

### Font

Georgia and Verdana were chosen mainly because they're free but also because they were designed for print. Italicized Georgia is both elegant and commanding. Verdana is clear. 

## Google Resume Template

This is a free template to help your resume stand. My Microsoft office account expired after leaving college and so with it free resume templates. I saw there weren't a lot of clean and simple resume templates for Google Docs and so created one.
